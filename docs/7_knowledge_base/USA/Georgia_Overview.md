## Executive Summary

Georgia operates a **two-tier residential care system** distinguishing between Personal Care Homes (PCH) serving 2-24 residents and Assisted Living Communities (ALC) serving 25 or more residents. This capacity-based bifurcation creates distinct regulatory frameworks reflecting facility size, complexity, and operational requirements.

The **Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH)** Healthcare Facility Regulation Division (HFRD) regulates both Personal Care Homes and Assisted Living Communities, bringing healthcare facility expertise to residential care oversight. DCH manages licensing, inspection, complaint investigation, enforcement, and policy development for all residential care facilities statewide.

Georgia's regulatory structure emphasizes **resident-centered care**, **aging in place**, and **operational flexibility** while maintaining health and safety standards. The state's regulations permit diverse service models from small homelike personal care homes to large assisted living communities with specialized programming.

**Key Characteristics:**

Georgia's **capacity-based licensing structure** (PCH for 2-24 residents, ALC for 25+) creates clear regulatory pathways based on facility size rather than service intensity or resident acuity. This approach differs from states using service-based or acuity-based licensing categories.

The state's **minimum capacity of two residents** for Personal Care Homes enables very small facilities, promoting homelike environments and family-style care models. This low threshold distinguishes Georgia from states requiring higher minimum capacities.

Georgia requires **private rooms** for Assisted Living Communities (25+ residents), ensuring privacy and dignity for residents in larger facilities. Personal Care Homes may provide shared accommodations, offering flexibility for smaller facilities.

The state does **not require administrator certification**, instead relying on facility-level accountability for administrator qualifications. However, administrators must complete DCH-approved training addressing Georgia regulations and operational requirements.
