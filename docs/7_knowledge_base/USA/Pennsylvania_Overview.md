**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of Pennsylvania's residential care regulatory system for Harmony AI Knowledge Base

## Executive Summary

Pennsylvania operates a **dual-track residential care system** distinguishing between Personal Care Homes (PCH) and Assisted Living Residences (ALR). This bifurcated approach reflects Pennsylvania's evolution from traditional personal care models to more service-intensive assisted living frameworks, creating regulatory complexity but also service flexibility.

**Key Characteristics:**

Pennsylvania's regulatory structure emphasizes **clear service level differentiation** through separate licensing categories. Personal Care Homes provide basic personal care and supervision under 55 Pa. Code Chapter 2600, while Assisted Living Residences offer enhanced services including nursing oversight and specialized care under 55 Pa. Code Chapter 2800. This dual structure enables consumers to select settings matching their needs while providing regulatory clarity for operators.

The state requires **100-hour administrator training** for Personal Care Home administrators, one of the most comprehensive training requirements nationally. This substantial investment in administrator education reflects Pennsylvania's commitment to quality leadership and regulatory knowledge.

Pennsylvania's **Department of Human Services (DHS)** regulates both PCHs and ALRs, bringing social services expertise to residential care oversight. This contrasts with health department regulation in many states, emphasizing person-centered care and community integration over medical models.

## Regulatory Structure

### Single Agency Authority

**Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (DHS)** serves as the exclusive regulatory authority for Personal Care Homes and Assisted Living Residences. DHS's Bureau of Human Services Licensing (BHSL) manages all aspects of residential care oversight including licensing, inspection, complaint investigation, enforcement, and policy development.

The centralized structure under DHS promotes consistency and accountability across Pennsylvania's diverse residential care industry. Regional licensing offices provide localized oversight and technical assistance while maintaining statewide policy consistency.

## Facility Types and Definitions

### Personal Care Homes (PCH)

**Definition:** Personal Care Homes provide residential settings for adults who do not require the services of a licensed long-term care facility (nursing home) but who do require assistance with activities of daily living, supervision, and protective oversight.

**Statutory Authority:** 55 Pa. Code Chapter 2600

**Capacity:** Personal Care Homes must serve a minimum of three residents. There is no statutory maximum capacity, though larger facilities face more stringent operational requirements.

**Resident Population:** PCHs serve adults who:
- Require assistance with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, eating, mobility)
- Need supervision and protective oversight
- Do not require continuous nursing care
- Are generally ambulatory or require limited mobility assistance
- Can participate in emergency evacuation with staff assistance

**Service Scope:** Personal Care Homes provide:
- Housing and accommodations
- Three nutritious meals daily plus snacks
- Assistance with activities of daily living
- Medication administration or supervision
- Supervision and protective oversight
- Social and recreational activities
- Housekeeping and laundry services
- Emergency response capabilities
- Coordination with healthcare providers

**Medication Services:** PCHs may provide medication administration services for residents assessed to need such assistance. Staff administering medications must complete approved medication administration training and demonstrate competency.

**Specialized Services:** Some PCHs provide specialized services for specific populations including:
- Memory care for residents with dementia
- Mental health services for residents with psychiatric conditions
- Services for residents with intellectual disabilities

**Licensing:** PCHs require DHS licensure with biennial renewal. Licenses are facility-specific and non-transferable.

### Assisted Living Residences (ALR)

**Definition:** Assisted Living Residences provide housing, 24-hour supervision and assistance, and coordination of services with the underlying philosophy of promoting resident independence, choice, dignity, privacy, and homelike surroundings.

**Statutory Authority:** 55 Pa. Code Chapter 2800

**Enhanced Service Model:** ALRs provide more intensive services than PCHs, including nursing oversight, enhanced personal care, and specialized programming. The ALR model emphasizes aging in place, allowing residents to remain in familiar settings as care needs increase.

**Capacity:** ALRs must serve a minimum of three residents. Capacity limits depend on physical plant and staffing adequacy.

**Resident Population:** ALRs serve adults who:
- Require assistance with multiple activities of daily living
- Need nursing oversight and health monitoring
- May have complex medication regimens
- Require enhanced supervision and support
- Can benefit from specialized programming (dementia care, mental health services)
- Are appropriate for residential rather than nursing home settings

**Service Scope:** Assisted Living Residences provide:
- Private or semi-private accommodations
- Three meals daily plus snacks
- 24-hour supervision and assistance
- Nursing services and health monitoring
- Comprehensive personal care assistance
- Medication management and administration
- Specialized programming and services
- Social and recreational activities
- Housekeeping and laundry services
- Emergency response systems
- Transportation assistance
- Coordination with healthcare providers and community services

**Nursing Services:** ALRs must employ or contract with licensed nurses (RNs or LPNs) to provide:
- Initial and ongoing resident health assessments
- Nursing care plan development and implementation
- Medication management oversight
- Health monitoring and intervention
- Coordination with physicians and healthcare providers
- Staff training and supervision
- Quality assurance and compliance monitoring

**Special Care Designations:** ALRs may obtain special care designations for:
- Alzheimer's and dementia care
- Mental health services
- Other specialized populations

Special care designations require enhanced staffing, specialized training, environmental modifications, and program-specific requirements.

**Dual Licensure:** Facilities may hold both PCH and ALR licenses, allowing them to serve residents with varying acuity levels within the same physical plant. Dual licensure requires compliance with both Chapter 2600 and Chapter 2800 regulations.

**Licensing:** ALRs require DHS licensure with biennial renewal. Special care designations require additional approval processes.
