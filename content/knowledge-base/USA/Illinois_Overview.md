**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** November 30, 2024  
**Author:** Manus AI Research Team  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of Illinois's residential care regulatory system for Harmony AI Knowledge Base

---

## Executive Summary

Illinois operates a **dual-track residential care system** with distinct regulatory frameworks for Assisted Living Establishments (ALE) and Supportive Living Facilities (SLF). This bifurcated structure reflects Illinois's commitment to both private-pay market flexibility and Medicaid-funded supportive living innovation.

**Key Characteristics:**

Illinois's regulatory approach distinguishes between **Assisted Living Establishments** (regulated under 77 IAC Part 295 and 210 ILCS 9/) serving primarily private-pay residents, and **Supportive Living Facilities** (regulated under 89 IAC Part 146 and 305 ILCS 5/5-5.01a) serving Medicaid-eligible individuals through an innovative alternative to nursing home placement. This dual structure enables market segmentation while promoting aging in place across payment sources.

The **Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH)** regulates Assisted Living Establishments and Shared Housing Establishments, bringing public health expertise to residential care oversight. The **Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS)** certifies Supportive Living Facilities as Medicaid providers, creating dual oversight for facilities serving both private-pay and Medicaid populations.

Illinois's **Supportive Living Program (SLP)** represents one of the nation's most successful Medicaid-funded assisted living initiatives, serving thousands of individuals who would otherwise require nursing home placement. The program's emphasis on apartment-style living, resident autonomy, and person-centered services has influenced assisted living policy nationally.

The state's **apartment-style requirement** for Assisted Living Establishments (single-occupancy private units) distinguishes Illinois from states permitting shared rooms, reflecting consumer preference for privacy and independence. Shared Housing Establishments provide an alternative for residents preferring or requiring shared accommodations.

## Regulatory Structure

### Dual Agency Authority

**Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH)** regulates Assisted Living Establishments and Shared Housing Establishments through its Division of Assisted Living. IDPH manages licensing, inspection, complaint investigation, enforcement, and policy development for assisted living statewide.

**Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS)** certifies and oversees Supportive Living Facilities as Medicaid providers. HFS establishes program standards, reimbursement rates, quality assurance requirements, and compliance monitoring for SLP facilities.

The dual agency structure creates complexity for facilities serving both private-pay and Medicaid populations, requiring compliance with both IDPH licensure standards and HFS certification requirements. However, this structure also enables specialized expertise—IDPH brings public health and safety focus while HFS brings Medicaid program management and person-centered care expertise.
