**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of Ohio's residential care regulatory system for Harmony AI Knowledge Base

---

## Executive Summary

Ohio operates a **unified residential care facility (RCF) regulatory system** under Chapter 3721 of the Ohio Revised Code and Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3701-16. Unlike states with multiple license types based on service levels or resident acuity, Ohio uses a single licensing category for residential care facilities, creating regulatory simplicity and operational flexibility.

**Key Characteristics:**

Ohio's regulatory approach emphasizes **flexibility and resident choice** through a single licensing framework accommodating diverse facility sizes, service models, and resident populations. Residential care facilities in Ohio range from small homes serving a few residents to large communities serving hundreds, all regulated under the same basic standards with enhanced requirements for facilities serving residents with greater needs.

The **Ohio Department of Health (ODH)** serves as the sole regulatory authority for residential care facilities, bringing public health expertise to oversight. ODH's Division of Quality Assurance manages licensing, inspection, complaint investigation, enforcement, and policy development for RCFs statewide.

Ohio's **two-year license term** provides operational stability compared to states requiring annual renewal, reducing administrative burden while maintaining accountability through biennial inspections and ongoing complaint investigations.

The state's regulations permit **flexible unit configurations** including private rooms, semi-private rooms, and shared accommodations up to four residents per unit, enabling facilities to serve diverse resident preferences and economic circumstances. This flexibility distinguishes Ohio from states mandating apartment-style or private accommodations.

Ohio does **not require administrator certification or specific educational credentials**, instead relying on facility-level accountability for administrator qualifications and performance. This approach contrasts with states mandating extensive administrator training and certification, reflecting Ohio's emphasis on operational flexibility over prescriptive requirements.

### Legislative and Regulatory Framework

**Statutory Authority:** Ohio Revised Code (ORC) Chapter 3721 establishes ODH's authority to license and regulate residential care facilities, defining facility types, resident rights, operational standards, and enforcement mechanisms.

**Administrative Regulations:** Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3701-16 provides comprehensive regulatory standards covering:
- Licensure procedures and requirements
- Administrator responsibilities
- Physical plant standards
- Staffing requirements

## Facility Definition and Capacity

### Residential Care Facility (RCF)

**Definition:** Residential care facilities are institutions, residences, or facilities that provide, for a period exceeding 24 hours, accommodations to three or more unrelated individuals and supervision and personal care services to residents who do not require skilled nursing care.

**Statutory Authority:** ORC Chapter 3721 and OAC Chapter 3701-16

**Minimum Capacity:** Three unrelated residents (lower than many states, enabling small homelike settings)

**Maximum Capacity:** No statutory maximum; capacity determined by physical plant, staffing adequacy, and operational capabilities

**Resident Population:** RCFs serve adults who:
- Require supervision and personal care services
- Do not require skilled nursing care
- Are generally ambulatory or require limited mobility assistance
- Can participate in emergency evacuation with staff assistance
- May have cognitive impairments including dementia (with appropriate services)

**Service Scope:** Residential care facilities provide:
- Housing and accommodations
- Three meals daily plus snacks
- Supervision and monitoring
- Personal care services (assistance with activities of daily living)
- Medication administration or supervision
- Social and recreational activities
- Housekeeping and laundry services
- Emergency response capabilities
- Coordination with healthcare providers
- Transportation assistance (optional)

**Flexible Service Model:** Ohio's single licensing category enables facilities to serve residents with varying needs and acuity levels, from relatively independent individuals requiring minimal assistance to residents with significant care needs including dementia. Facilities must ensure adequate staffing and services to meet resident needs regardless of acuity.

**Special Care Units:** RCFs may designate special care units for residents with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias, requiring enhanced staffing, specialized training, environmental modifications, and dementia-specific programming.

**Licensing:** RCFs require ODH licensure with **biennial (2-year) renewal**, providing operational stability compared to annual renewal requirements in many states.
