# New York Residential Care Facilities - Comprehensive State Overview

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** November 30, 2024  
**Author:** Manus AI Research Team  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of New York's residential care regulatory system for Harmony AI Knowledge Base

---

## Executive Summary

New York operates a unique and complex residential care regulatory system distinguished by its **facility-based licensing model** and **service overlay structure**. Unlike most states that license based primarily on services provided, New York licenses facilities by type (Adult Homes, Enriched Housing Programs, Assisted Living Residences) and then authorizes additional services through program certifications, most notably the **Assisted Living Program (ALP)**, a Medicaid State Plan service.

**Key Characteristics:**

New York's regulatory approach reflects the state's emphasis on **consumer protection**, **medical model oversight**, and **Medicaid integration**. The New York State Department of Health (DOH) serves as the sole regulatory authority, bringing healthcare facility expertise to adult care regulation. This medical model orientation distinguishes New York from states emphasizing social or residential models.

The state's **Certificate of Need (CON)** requirement for new facilities creates significant market entry barriers, limiting supply and maintaining regulatory control over capacity expansion. This approach contrasts sharply with states allowing market-driven facility development.

New York's large and diverse residential care market—serving over 40,000 residents in more than 500 licensed facilities—encompasses urban, suburban, and rural settings with varying demographic and service needs. The state's regulatory system must balance New York City's dense urban environment with upstate rural communities, creating complexity in standardized regulation.

## Regulatory Structure

### Single Agency Authority

**New York State Department of Health (DOH)** serves as the exclusive regulatory authority for all adult care facilities in New York. DOH's Bureau of Licensure and Certification manages licensing, inspection, complaint investigation, enforcement, and policy development for adult care facilities statewide.

The centralized structure under DOH brings healthcare facility regulatory expertise to adult care oversight, emphasizing medical safety, infection control, and clinical standards. This healthcare-oriented approach distinguishes New York from states where social services or aging services agencies regulate residential care.

- Housekeeping and laundry services
- Personal care assistance (bathing, dressing, grooming)
- Supervision and monitoring
- Social and recreational activities
- Medication administration and supervision
- Coordination with healthcare providers

**Licensing:** Adult Homes require DOH licensure and Certificate of Need for establishment or expansion.

### Enriched Housing Programs (EHP)

**Definition:** Enriched Housing Programs provide housing and supportive services to adults who are substantially unable to live independently, emphasizing a more independent living model than Adult Homes.

**Statutory Authority:** Social Services Law and 10 NYCRR Part 485

**Service Model:** EHPs emphasize resident independence and community integration while providing supportive services as needed. The model originated to serve elderly individuals transitioning from independent living who need some support but not the comprehensive services of Adult Homes.

- Assistance with transferring and mobility
- Specialized dementia care
- Enhanced supervision and monitoring
- Additional staffing

**Capacity:** Varies; typically emphasizes smaller, homelike settings.

**Licensing:** Requires base license as Adult Home or EHP, plus ALR certification from DOH.

### Assisted Living Program (ALP)

**Definition:** ALP is a **Medicaid State Plan service** (not a facility license type) that operates in facilities licensed as Adult Homes or Enriched Housing Programs. ALP provides an alternative to nursing home placement for Medicaid-eligible individuals.

**Statutory Authority:** Social Services Law and 18 NYCRR Part 505

**Service Model:** ALP serves individuals who would otherwise require nursing home level of care but can be appropriately served in less intensive assisted living settings. ALP integrates personal care, nursing services, therapy, and other supports.

**Eligibility:** ALP participants must:
