## Executive Summary

Texas operates a comprehensive residential care system regulated primarily by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) for adult facilities and the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) for children's facilities. The state distinguishes facility types based on **age stratification** (elderly/adults vs. children) and **acuity levels** (Type A vs. Type B based on emergency evacuation capability and nighttime attendance needs).

**Key Characteristics of the Texas System:**

Texas employs a **binary classification system** for assisted living facilities based on residents' functional abilities rather than services provided. Type A facilities serve individuals capable of self-evacuation and not requiring nighttime attendance, while Type B facilities accommodate residents needing staff assistance for emergency evacuation and continuous overnight supervision. This functional classification directly impacts physical plant requirements, staffing ratios, and operational standards.

The regulatory framework emphasizes **resident-centered care** with strong protections for autonomy, dignity, and self-determination. Texas law explicitly identifies ten components of quality care including resident independence, humane treatment, conservative intervention, access to care, continuity of care, coordination of services, safe surroundings, professionalism, participation in useful studies, and quality of life.

## Regulatory Structure

### Primary Regulatory Agencies

**Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)** serves as the primary regulatory authority for adult residential care facilities. HHSC's Long-Term Care Regulatory (LTCR) division manages licensing, inspection, enforcement, and policy development for assisted living facilities. The agency operates through regional offices providing localized oversight and technical assistance to providers across the state's diverse geographic regions.

**Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS)** regulates residential child care through its Child Care Regulation division. DFPS oversees 24-hour residential operations serving children and youth, including general residential operations, residential treatment centers, and emergency shelters. The department coordinates closely with HHSC on policy development while maintaining specialized expertise in child welfare and protection.

### Legislative and Regulatory Framework

**Statutory Authority:** Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 247 establishes the Assisted Living Facility Licensing Act, providing comprehensive statutory authority for ALF regulation. The statute defines facility types, establishes licensing requirements, specifies prohibited practices, creates enforcement mechanisms, and protects resident rights. Chapter 247 underwent significant reorganization in 2021 to improve clarity and accessibility.

**Administrative Regulations:** Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Title 26, Part 1, Chapter 553 contains detailed licensing standards for assisted living facilities. These regulations translate statutory requirements into specific, measurable standards covering physical plant, staffing, services, health and safety, residents' rights, and administrative operations. Chapter 553 was comprehensively revised in 2021, with the most recent amendments effective in 2024.

**Child Care Regulations:** TAC Title 40, Chapter 748 establishes minimum standards for General Residential Operations serving children. These standards address capacity limits, staffing qualifications, child supervision, educational services, behavioral management, health care, and physical plant requirements specific to children's developmental needs.

## Facility Types and Definitions

### Assisted Living Facilities (ALF)

**Statutory Definition:** An assisted living facility provides "food and shelter to four or more persons who are unrelated to the proprietor of the facility and provides personal care services or administration of medication by a person licensed or otherwise authorized in this state to administer the medication" (Health and Safety Code §247.002).

**Type A Facilities** serve residents who possess the physical and mental capability to evacuate the facility independently during emergencies and do not require routine attendance during sleeping hours. These facilities typically serve higher-functioning individuals who need assistance with activities of daily living but retain substantial independence. Type A designation permits less intensive staffing patterns and somewhat relaxed physical plant requirements compared to Type B facilities.

**Type B Facilities** accommodate residents who require staff assistance to evacuate the facility during emergencies or are not capable of following directions in emergency situations. These residents require nighttime attendance for safety and supervision. Type B facilities must maintain higher staffing ratios, enhanced safety systems, and more stringent physical plant standards to ensure resident safety given the population's increased vulnerability.

**Type C Facilities** represent a specialized subcategory serving exclusively persons with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. These facilities must obtain both standard ALF licensure and additional Alzheimer's certification. Type C designation requires specialized staff training, enhanced security measures to prevent elopement, therapeutic programming specific to dementia care, and physical environments designed to support cognitive impairment.

**Capacity and Size Classifications:** Texas further classifies ALFs by size, with "small" facilities serving 16 or fewer residents and "large" facilities serving 17 or more residents. Size classification affects inspection frequency, plan review requirements, and certain operational standards. Large facilities face more frequent inspections and enhanced documentation requirements.

### Residential Care Services

**Program Description:** Residential Care (RC) represents a Medicaid-funded program providing 24-hour care in licensed assisted living facilities for adults who would otherwise require nursing facility placement. RC serves as a community-based alternative to institutional care, supporting individuals with significant functional limitations while preserving autonomy and community integration.

**Eligibility Requirements:** RC participants must be 21 years or older, meet nursing facility level of care criteria, qualify financially for Medicaid, and reside in a licensed assisted living facility. Participants undergo comprehensive assessment to determine service needs and develop individualized service plans. The program emphasizes person-centered planning and consumer direction.

**Service Components:** RC provides room and board, personal assistance with activities of daily living, medication administration or supervision, health-related services, and care coordination. Services are delivered according to individualized service plans developed collaboratively with participants, families, and interdisciplinary teams.

### 24-Hour Residential Child Care

**General Residential Operations (GRO)** provide 24-hour care for seven or more children aged 17 years or younger. GROs may offer various treatment services, emergency care, or basic residential services depending on their specific license type and service model. These operations serve children removed from their homes due to abuse, neglect, delinquency, or family crisis.

**Residential Treatment Centers (RTC)** provide intensive therapeutic services for children with serious emotional disturbances or behavioral health needs. RTCs integrate clinical treatment with residential care, offering individual therapy, group therapy, family therapy, psychiatric services, and specialized educational programming. Texas has undertaken significant RTC reform to improve quality and outcomes.

**Emergency Shelters** provide short-term residential care (typically 30 days or less) for children in crisis situations. Shelters offer immediate safety, basic needs provision, assessment services, and transition planning to more permanent placements. Emergency shelters play a critical role in the child welfare continuum.

## Licensing Requirements

### Application Process

**Initial Licensure:** Prospective ALF operators must submit comprehensive applications through the Texas Unified Licensure Information Portal (TULIP), HHSC's online licensing system. The application requires detailed information about the applicant's background, facility location and design, operational plans, staffing structure, policies and procedures, and financial viability.

**Background Checks:** All applicants, administrators, and direct care staff must undergo Level 2 background checks including FBI fingerprint-based criminal history checks and checks against state abuse registries. Texas maintains a Nurse Aide Registry and Employee Misconduct Registry to prevent individuals with disqualifying histories from working in long-term care settings.

**Pre-Licensure Training:** All ALF license applicants must complete mandatory pre-licensure computer-based training covering Texas ALF regulations, resident rights, health and safety requirements, and operational standards. This training ensures baseline knowledge before facility operation begins.

**Plan Review:** New construction, additions, or major renovations require submission of architectural plans for review and approval before construction begins. Plan review ensures compliance with Life Safety Code, accessibility standards, and Texas-specific physical plant requirements. Budget plan review fees range from $350 to 50% of the plan review fee depending on project scope.

### License Types and Fees

**Standard License:** The basic ALF license authorizes operation of an assisted living facility serving the general adult population. Standard licenses are issued for two-year periods and require renewal with updated documentation, fee payment, and demonstration of continued compliance.

**Specialized Licenses:** Texas issues specialized licenses or certifications for facilities serving specific populations or providing enhanced services. Alzheimer's certification requires additional training, environmental modifications, and specialized programming. Other specializations may include mental health services, developmental disabilities, or specific medical needs.

**License Fees:** Initial license application fees total $300 plus $75 per licensed bed. Renewal fees follow the same structure. Fees may be adjusted annually at a rate not exceeding the Consumer Price Index. Additional fees apply for plan review, late renewal, and certain administrative actions.

### Ongoing Compliance Requirements

**Inspections:** HHSC conducts unannounced inspections of all licensed ALFs at least annually, with more frequent inspections for facilities with compliance histories or serving higher-acuity populations. Inspections assess compliance with all regulatory standards through record review, staff interviews, resident interviews, and facility observation.

**Complaint Investigations:** HHSC investigates all complaints alleging violations of resident rights, health and safety standards, or regulatory requirements. Investigations are initiated within timeframes based on complaint severity, with immediate response for allegations of abuse, neglect, or exploitation.

**Reporting Requirements:** Facilities must report specified incidents to HHSC within mandated timeframes. Reportable incidents include deaths, serious injuries, abuse or neglect allegations, medication errors causing harm, law enforcement involvement, facility emergencies, and outbreaks of communicable disease.

## Staffing Requirements

### Administrator Qualifications

**Education and Experience:** ALF administrators must be at least 21 years old and possess either a high school diploma or GED. Administrators must complete a 40-hour ALF administrator training course covering Texas regulations, resident rights, business operations, personnel management, and quality assurance. Administrators with certain professional licenses (nursing, social work) may receive training exemptions.

**Responsibilities:** The administrator serves as the facility's chief executive officer, responsible for overall operation, regulatory compliance, quality assurance, personnel management, financial oversight, and community relations. Administrators must be physically present at the facility for at least 40 hours per week, with on-call availability during non-business hours.

**Continuing Education:** Administrators must complete 24 hours of continuing education every two years to maintain competency and stay current with regulatory changes, best practices, and industry developments. Continuing education must cover topics relevant to ALF operations and resident care.

### Direct Care Staffing

**Staffing Ratios:** Texas does not mandate specific numerical staffing ratios for ALFs, instead requiring "sufficient staff" to meet residents' assessed needs and provide services described in service plans. This flexible approach allows facilities to adjust staffing based on resident acuity, facility layout, and service model. However, HHSC may determine staffing is insufficient if residents experience unmet needs or safety concerns.

**Minimum Staffing:** At least one awake staff member must be present in the facility at all times. Type B facilities must maintain at least one staff member awake and on duty during nighttime hours for every 16 residents. Additional staff must be available to respond to emergencies and provide assistance as needed.

**Staff Qualifications:** Direct care staff must be at least 18 years old, possess a high school diploma or GED, complete facility orientation and training, and pass background checks. Staff providing personal care services must complete training in infection control, resident rights, emergency procedures, and person-centered care principles.

**Training Requirements:** All staff must complete initial orientation covering facility policies, emergency procedures, resident rights, abuse prevention, and job-specific duties. Direct care staff must complete at least 24 hours of annual continuing education addressing topics such as dementia care, medication administration, fall prevention, and person-centered care.

### Specialized Staff

**Nursing Services:** ALFs must employ or contract with a licensed nurse (RN or LVN) to provide nursing oversight, medication administration training and supervision, health assessment, care planning, and coordination with healthcare providers. The level of nursing involvement depends on residents' health needs and services provided.

**Activity Programming:** Facilities must designate staff responsible for planning and implementing activity programs that support residents' physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being. Activity staff should have training or experience in recreational programming, therapeutic activities, or related fields.
